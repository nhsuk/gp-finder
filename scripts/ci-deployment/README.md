# CI Deployment Scripts

This repo contains deployment scripts executed during project builds on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)

The scripts should work across a number of repos that include a `Dockerfile`. They are intended to be included as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) within the code repo.

Including this repo within your own (as detailed below) will:
* Build and tag the Docker image as detailed in the repo's `Dockerfile`. This happens on PR creation and update, Tagging (including Release) and commits to the `master` branch.
* Push the image to the appropriate docker repo
* If the Travis build has been triggered by a PR a new stack will be created within the dev environment in Rancher. The rancher and docker templates used to build the stack are pulled from the [nhsuk/nhsuk-rancher-templates](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-rancher-templates) repo on GitHub. The specific compose files are determined by the env var `RANCHER_TEMPLATE_NAME` and the subdirectory '0' is always used.
* In order to identify dependent services the PR script inspects rancher-compose.yml. Dependent services are those identified from the question variables ending in 'docker_image_tag' which don't match the current service repo name. For example, the presence of a question variable named pharmacy_db_docker_image_tag in the rancher-compose file for [c2s-pharmacy-finder](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-rancher-templates/tree/master/templates/c2s-pharmacy-finder) indicates that pharmacy-db is a dependent service and that, whilst the variable connecting_to_services_docker_image_tag exists, connecting-to-services would not be a dependent service.
* The naming convention employed between GitHub, Docker and Rancher is for the docker images to be named the same as the GitHub repo with the hyphen transcribed to underscore due to limitations in rancher naming.
* The image tag deployed for each *dependent* service is that of the latest GitHub release. Releases tagged as pre-release will be ignored. This may need to be revisited when we have to make changes in two dependent repos for a given PR.
* A publicly accessible URL to the stack will be published in the PR's comments

## Setup in code repo

1. Add this repo as a submodule `git submodule add https://github.com/nhsuk/ci-deployment.git` (note if the submodule is added in a path other than the default the path to the scripts in `.travis.yml` will need updating to that same path)
1. Update that repo's `.travis.yml` to include the sections included within this repo's `.travis.yml` i.e. the ability to run docker, the `after_success` section and the global environment variables
1. Setup Travis for the repo. Include any private [environment variables](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings) not already available within the Travis environment (described below)
1. Run a build via a PR, TAG, Branch and check everything is working


## Environment variables

As the scripts are intended to be run from within the Travis CI environment they use a number of environment variables available within that environment. The table below highlights those that are used along with any additional ones that need to be added to the environment. Additional information about Travis environment variables can be found https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Default-Environment-Variables. To help setting up Travis all of the non-secret env vars have been added to the example `.travis.yml`

There is a utility script [here](./configure-travis-env.sh) to set the non-Travis environment variables from the command line.
It assumes you have the Travis CLI installed and you are already logged into Travis.

Finally, it is worth noting that it is possible to run the PR script locally by setting the environment variables. For example:

 `TRAVIS=true TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG=nhsuk/connecting-to-services TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST=<PR number of an image which still exists>  RANCHER_TEMPLATE_NAME=c2s-pharmacy-finder SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN=<splunk token> GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<personal access token> ./rancher_pr_deploy.sh`

 If testing changes to the rancher template during development  RANCHER_TEMPLATE_BRANCH_NAME can also be set (see above for details).
